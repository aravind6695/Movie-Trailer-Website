# Movie Trailer Website
This project generates a website that displays movie information and plays YouTube trailers.

This project is part of the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) at _Udacity_. It was built on the starter code provided, by including _Python_ scripts that get and store movie data from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using their API.

### Getting Started
- Make sure you have **Python** installed in your machine.
- Download and extract the zip file, or clone the repository using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/aravind6695/Movie-Trailer-Website.git
```
- Navigate into the directory using the `cd` command.
- Run the following command to generate the HTML code for the website:
```
python entertainment_center.py
```
- The file `fresh_tomatoes.html` is created.
